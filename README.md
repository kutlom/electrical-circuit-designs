## LTspice Circuit Designs

This repository contains LTspice circuit schematics designed during my third year and fourth year of Electrical Engineering at the University of Toronto.

The projects demonstrate my understanding of:
- Analog and power electronics
- Circuit analysis and simulation
- Design trade-offs and component selection

## Projects Included

- CMOS and Operational Amplifier Circuit
- Buck Converter
- Boost Converter
- Buck-Boost Converter
- Cuk Converter
- Inverting Buck-Boost Converter

Each project folder includes:
- LTspice schematic (.asc)
- Exported schematic image (.png)
- Brief technical explanation

## Tools
- LTspice
- Circuit theory & simulation
